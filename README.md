# IT 202: Object-Oriented Programming

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Programming** course repository! This course is designed for university-level students enrolled in IT 202. Over the semester, we will explore the object-oriented programming paradigm, learning to create robust, modular, and reusable code.

## Course Description

The **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course introduces students to the object-oriented programming paradigm. Students will engage with core concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. By the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation in OOP and will be able to apply these principles to develop scalable and efficient software solutions.

The course emphasizes practical implementation through problem-solving, creating reusable code structures, and developing real-world applications. Students will work on individual and group projects, fostering collaboration and peer learning. In addition to mastering OOP fundamentals, advanced topics such as design patterns, generics, exception handling, and graphical user interfaces will be covered.

Throughout the course, students will gain proficiency in testing, debugging, and using object-oriented principles effectively in software development. Adherence to coding best practices, documentation, and adaptability to new technologies will also be integral parts of this course, preparing students for professional software development environments.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand and apply the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Develop reusable, modular, and maintainable code using OOP.
- Gain proficiency in problem-solving and creating OOP-based applications in the chosen programming language.
- Work effectively in collaborative environments through group projects.
- Test, debug, and document OOP code, ensuring adherence to coding best practices.
- Explore advanced OOP topics such as design patterns, generics, and functional programming constructs.
- Adapt OOP principles to evolving technologies and software development scenarios.
